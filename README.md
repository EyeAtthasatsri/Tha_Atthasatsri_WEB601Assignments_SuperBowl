# Tha_Atthasatsri_WEB601Assignments_SuperBowl

This is the third time working on this project, 
and I realized I've been doing some parts incorrectly, so I had to delete them.

I created this project last Thursday after finishing Quiz 1 in class. 
I took my time and focused on completing the installation part.

After that I wrote the code by following the video recorded in class. - as demonstrated and explained by the professor.

Video as I recoded; demonstate about  

 - About class name
 - content list
 - content card by using "ng generate component" command

So I don't know what should I do next about content list
which should add this._items in <p>${{}}</p> as prof. told in class

but I tried it's gonna be errors (red message), as well about this code below. 
    
    increaseCount(): number {
    return ++ContentList.contentCount;
  }


To be honest, I asked some AIs, there showed as below

    <p>ID: ${content.id}</p>
    <p>Title: ${content.title}</p>
    <p>Description: ${content.description}</p>
    <p>Creator: ${content.creator}</p>
    <p>Type: ${content.type}</p>

When I had follow from that AIs so those error disappear. I have no idea what going on?!

Sorry to say this. . I give up!
And now, it's almost time's up!
